You will think of abstract when you hear math. But today we will talk about the main two thoughts of math.

   The first is systematic that is like to Western math and the second is programming that is like is to eastern math. For now let me show you a example to understand the distinction of them.  

   Assume that when someone meet a problem, the systematic person will find out all of the knowledge about problem and the programming person will find out the local knowledge of the problem. At another, the programming one will find the steps of solving the problem and the systematic one will find the systematic knowledge of the problem.
